This project utilizes ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling in order to forecast the prices of a future stock. This leverages time series data to predict future trends. The code uses pandas to read a csv file containing past stock prices, matplotlib to plot data, seasonal_decompose to decompose the time series into seasonal trends. I am currently working on allowing for user input, so that the user can give the program the past data. Then I could use streamlit to build a future stock predicting app in which a user can input past stock data and receive future predictions.
